CS 3550 Assignment 1 (HTML)
===========================

In this assignment, you will set up a web server serving HTML web
pages for the grading application. We will build upon this HTML code,
and this web server, in later assignments. Specifically, in this
assignment, you will demonstrate that you can:

- Configure and start a basic web server using Django
- Create basic web pages using HTML for data/content and CSS for style
  and placement
- Understand many common HTML structural, textual, and media elements
- Understand common HTML element attributes for those elements

This assignment is intended take 6--8 hours and must be done solo. If
you've been working on it for longer than that and feel stuck, go get
help on Discord or sign up for an office hours slot.

Phase 1: Starting the web server
--------------------------------

First, install all of the required software and make
sure all the indicated commands work.

Second, check out your Github repository and rename the folder to
`cs3550`. You will do all of your coding for this class inside this
folder.

Third, run the following set of commands:

    cd <path>/cs3550
    python3 -m django startproject cs3550 .

In the first command, replace `<path>` with whatever path is necessary
to get to the Git checkout. The second command creates a Django
"project" called `cs3550` and puts it in the current directory.

Test that this worked by running:

    python3 manage.py runserver

This should print some messages, ending with the line "Quit the server
with CONTROL-C". Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/;
you should see a page informing you that "The install worked
successfully! Congratulations!" You can now press `Ctrl+C` in the
terminal to stop the server.

*MacOS users*: In some cases, depending on where you've put these
files, you may see errors from "Watchman". Usually this means you need
to press "yes" some some permissions dialogs that have popped up, but
if the error persists, you can add `--noreload` to the `runserver`
command. This disables Watchman, but the cost is that you may need to
terminate and restart the server process every time you change your
application.

If at any point in these steps you get what looks like an error
message, get help.

Fifth, edit the file `cs3550/settings.py` inside your repository. Find
the line that starts with `STATIC_URL` and add the following line
below it:

    STATICFILES_DIRS = [ 'static/' ]

Create a directory called `static` inside your repository. Your
repository should now contain the following files and folders:

- A folder `cs3550`, which in turn contains `settings.py`, `urls.py`,
  `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`, and `__init__.py`. It might also contain a
  `__pycache__` directory, which is auto-generated by Python.
- A file `manage.py`, which you use ran above
- An empty folder `static`
- Possibly a file called `db.sqlite3`, which your application manages

Sixth, create the file `.gitignore` in the root of your repository.
Add the following contents:

    uploads/*
    db.sqlite3
    *.pyc
    .DS_Store
    autotester

This makes sure you don't commit any autogenerated files to Github.

Seventh, create a file `test.html` in the `static` directory. Add the
following contents:

    <!doctype html>
    The test worked.

Test that this all worked by running:

    python3 manage.py runserver --noreload

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/static/test.html

You should see the words "The test worked." on your screen. If you do,
commit everything to Github; Phase 1 is done. If you do not, get help.


Phase 2: Writing the assignments page
-------------------------------------

Create the file `index.html` in the `static` directory. In this file,
you can write HTML code, and the web page defined by that HTML code
will show up when you start the server (by executing the `runserver`
command) and go to http://localhost:8000/static/index.html in your
browser. Your task is add HTML code to this file to make an
"assignment" page for the grading application, which is intended to
look like so:

![A screenshot of an "assignment" page](assignment.png)

As you can see, there is a navigation bar, a header, basic data about
the assignment, an "action block" with details about grading, and a
description of the assignment, which itself contains styled text, a
bulleted list, and an image.

Because you are currently writing unstyled, basic HTML your web page
will look very different---for now. Without adding CSS code to style
your HTML, it will look quite plain. However, choosing the correct,
semantic HTML tags is essential for making the page stylable later on.

Additionally, keep in mind that the page:

- Must be valid HTML5
- Must contain the `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag.
- Must set the tab name to "Assignment 1 (HTML) - CS 3550" and set the
  tab icon to the [application icon](favicon.ico).
- Must contain exactly the same text and images
  
You can find a copy of the [favicon file](favicon.ico) in
the `resources` directory of this repository. It looks terrible but
that isn't the point. You can find a copy of the
[image](static/assignments.png) in the `static` directory of
this repository.

Use appropriate structural elements, including `<header>`, `<nav>`,
and `<main>` for the main areas of the page; `<em>`, `<strong>`, and
`<code>` for inline text markup; `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, and
`<p>` tags for text structure; and `<a>` and `<img>` tags for links
and images. Include all required attributes, such as `href` for `<a>`
tags and `src` for `<img>` tags.

In the header, make "Assignments" link to `assignments.html` and
"Profile" link to `profile.html`. (This way the links will all work
when you add more pages later.)
  
As you work on this web page, make sure to write valid, well-indented,
and easy-to-read HTML code. If you make mistakes, be sure to use the
browser developer tools to understand how your browser is interpreting
your HTML code and why it looks the way it does.

You do *not* need to explicitly write the `<html>`, `<head>`, or
`<body>` element, or write closing tags if they are optional. Nor do
you need the closing slash on void elements like `<img>`.

Grading Rubric
--------------

This assignment is worth 35 points. The different phases are worth
different weights:

**Phase 1** is worth 10 points. It is graded on:

- Your repository must contain a Django project named `cs3550`
- Your web server must start and respond to requests on `localhost`
- Your web server must successfully show the test page at
  http://localhost:8000/static/test.html
  
Note that if you don't complete this phase, it is impossible to grade
most of the others, so you won't receive a passing grade.

**Phase 2** is worth 25 points. It is graded on:

- All of the required content must be present.
- The appropriate structural HTML elements must be used for the
  various parts of the page.
- The appropriate textual elements must be used for all of the
  formatted text.
- The appropriate HTML attributes must be used where required.
